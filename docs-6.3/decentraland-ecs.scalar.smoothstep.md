## Scalar.SmoothStep() method

Interpolates between min and max with smoothing at the limits.

This function interpolates between min and max in a similar way to Lerp. However, the interpolation will gradually speed up from the start and slow down toward the end. This is useful for creating natural-looking animation, fading and other transitions.
